![The quintessential local — a Greek taverna](assets/hero.png)

**One command per local service on macOS.** `klh-local register suspenders --port 7799` writes the Caddy site fragment, claims `suspenders.local` over mDNS, records everything in a registry file, and reloads Caddy — zero sudo, zero downtime. One command per service, every time. Design details in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

> **Platform: macOS** — launchd, Bonjour/dns-sd, and Caddy. Linux needs avahi + systemd equivalents, which are not implemented.

## Install

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh). Caddy, the Caddyfile, and the user LaunchAgent are bootstrapped by the tool itself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/klh/local && cd local
echo 'alias klh-local="bun /Volumes/Sensitive/github/klh/local/bin/klh-local.ts"' >> ~/.zshrc
klh-local install          # brew install caddy (if missing) + LaunchAgent + Caddyfile
```

Or one step: `./install.sh` — deploys `bin/` to `~/.local/klh-local/`, wires `~/.local/bin/klh-local`, bootstraps the bar dashboard agent, and registers the board as `bar.local` (idempotent, converges on re-run).

## The verbs

**install** — one-time bootstrap: installs Caddy via Homebrew (if missing), writes the Caddyfile skeleton with the default-deny catch-all, and starts a user LaunchAgent (`com.klh-local.caddy`, KeepAlive) running `caddy run`. Ports :80/:443 are bound unprivileged — no root anywhere.

**register** — validate name + port, write the fragment, `caddy validate` + `caddy reload` (user-level, zero downtime), claim the `.local` hostname, record it:

```bash
klh-local register suspenders --port 7799 --health /
klh-local register belt --port 7791 --health / --route /status=4100
klh-local register myapp --port 8080 --no-dns    # no .local hostname claim
klh-local register wiki --port 8090 --lan --forward-auth https://sso.example.com/api/verify
```

**Loopback by default.** Every site binds `127.0.0.1 ::1`; nothing is reachable from the LAN unless registered with `--lan`, and `--lan` is refused without `--forward-auth <url>` — Caddy's `forward_auth` asks that endpoint (Authelia, Authentik, oauth2-proxy, your SSO) before proxying. A fragment that fails `caddy validate` never lands in `sites/` (it is validated in a staging copy first), and a failed reload restores the previous fragment.

Re-running register with the same name + port **converges** — fragment rewritten, Caddy reloaded, the dns claim reused when alive and re-claimed only when dead — so install scripts can call it on every run. Changing the port requires `deregister` first.

`--route /path=port` (repeatable) adds path routes as Caddy `handle` blocks ahead of the default — path-preserving passthroughs to another local port, e.g. `https://belt.local/status*` → the gateway on :4100. A route path without a trailing `*` gets one (subtree match).

**list**

```console
$ klh-local list
belt         :7791   http://belt.local/         loop  dns: pid 41237    2026-09-28
suspenders   :7799   http://suspenders.local/   loop  dns: pid 41251    2026-09-28
```

**status** — health GET (1.5s timeout), dns-claim liveness (the pid must still be `dns-sd`), exposure, fragment presence. Read-only.

```console
$ klh-local status
suspenders  https://suspenders.local/ → 127.0.0.1:7799
  health   ok HTTP 200 3ms  (GET 127.0.0.1:7799/)
  dns      alive (pid 41251)
  exposure loopback only
  fragment ~/.local/state/klh-local/sites/suspenders.caddy
```

**deregister** — remove the fragment, kill the dns claim, forget the service:

```bash
klh-local deregister myapp
```

**reload** — after any hand edit to a managed file: `caddy validate` + `caddy reload`. No sudo, ever.

**hosts-apply** — rewrites one marked block in `/etc/hosts` from the registry:

```
# --- klh-local managed: start ---
127.0.0.1 belt.local
127.0.0.1 suspenders.local
# --- klh-local managed: end ---
```

macOS sends `*.local` to mDNS and hosts files cannot wildcard, so exact names in a marked block are the deterministic loopback path — without a resolver daemon hijacking printer/AirPlay `.local` names machine-wide. `register`/`deregister` print a drift hint when the file disagrees with the registry; the write itself is the one sudo in klh-local's world. The `.local` hostname is also claimed over mDNS (`dns-sd -P`, A record included): `127.0.0.1` for loopback services, the LAN address (en0, then the default-route interface) for `--lan` services so other devices resolve it. Under sudo the registry is found via `SUDO_USER` (or `--registry PATH`), and `/etc/hosts` is replaced atomically.

## Fleet surfaces

The convention (W148): **`suspenders.local` is the console** — the fleet board at :7799 with `/usage`; `bar.local` is the bar's own surface (:7792); `belt.local` serves the belt UI (:7791) with `/status*` passthrough to the LLM gateway (:4100). Repointing a host is a breaking change to its UI surface — additive `--route` passthroughs are the non-breaking way to add a path to another port.

**The `.local` name only answers while a dns-sd `-P` claim lives.** The claims are ephemeral (they die with the process — e.g. at reboot), and on this Darwin the `/etc/hosts` block alone is not enough from the LAN and stalls dual-stack resolvers locally: curl's AAAA lookup multicasts with nobody authoritative to answer, and the request times out even though the A record resolves to 127.0.0.1 (`curl -4` works, proving it). After any reboot: `klh-local register suspenders --port 7799 --health /` (and `bar`) re-claims — converge is idempotent. `--no-dns` is the escape hatch when another process (e.g. the belt lane's own wrapper) already announces the name — a second claimant makes the registrations conflict-rename each other.

HTTPS is Caddy's internal CA (auto-HTTPS): this Mac verifies clean (`ssl_verify_result 0`, `caddy trust` already applied); any other LAN device sees a self-signed warning on first visit until it imports Caddy's root (`~/.local/share/Caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt`).

## Bar

The registry, rendered live: [http://bar.local/](http://bar.local/) — one hairline row per service (name, port, target, health via the same 1.5s GET the `status` verb makes, dns-claim liveness, fragment presence, created date), under a Caddy line (:80 answering, `caddy version`) and the registry path. Vanilla JS refreshing every 3s, no frameworks, no external assets — a single-file Bun server, `bin/dashboard.ts`, wearing the shared klh theme so the bar reads as one product with belt.local and suspenders.local: dark/light tokens, the settings gear, and the `klh·fleet` strip linking belt · suspenders · local. `bin/klh-theme.ts` is a byte-identical copy of klh/suspenders `hooks/lib/theme.ts`; never edit it by hand: re-vendor it and bump the pin in `bin/dashboard.test.ts`.

![The bar — every local service, one honest row each](assets/bar.png)

- [http://bar.local/api/status](http://bar.local/api/status) — the same snapshot as JSON, health results included
- [http://bar.local/llms.txt](http://bar.local/llms.txt) — what klh-local is, in plain text

The board runs as a user LaunchAgent (`com.klh-local.dashboard`, `127.0.0.1:7792` — loopback only, Host-checked, no absolute paths in `/api/status`, `KLH_LOCAL_BAR_PORT`/`BELT_BAR_PORT` override; logs to `~/.local/state/klh-local/dashboard.log`). `install.sh` sets it up and registers the board itself as a service — the bar is just another row in its own table:

```bash
klh-local register bar --port 7792 --health /
```

Read-only by design: the bar probes and renders; it never registers, reloads, or claims.

## Security posture

- **Host-header safety** — names must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,30}$`. The name lands in three sensitive places (Host-header target, site address, filename under `sites/`); the regex makes Host-header injection, path traversal, and config-syntax smuggling impossible.
- **Loopback by default** — sites bind `127.0.0.1 ::1`; LAN exposure is per-service opt-in (`--lan`) and always behind `forward_auth`.
- **Never proxy based on user input** — `reverse_proxy` targets are always `127.0.0.1:<port>`, written from validated registry data at register time. Nothing request-time is interpolated into the config.
- **Default-deny** — a hostless catch-all block `abort`s every Host no fragment claims, on both :80 and :443 (unknown SNI fails at the TLS handshake — no cert without on-demand TLS). DNS-rebind attempts and stray `curl` Host headers die at the proxy, never reaching a backend.
- **Zero root** — Caddy runs as a user LaunchAgent; validate and reload are user-level and zero-downtime. The only sudo in klh-local's world is `hosts-apply`.
